What is Jokecoin?
-------------

Jokecoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant, private
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Jokecoin uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. JokeCoin Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the JokeCoin Core software, see https://www.jokecoin.org/get-jokecoin/.
